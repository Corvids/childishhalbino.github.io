{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h1><em>Day One:</em></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>Echo Fox (1-1) v TSM (1-1) -> TSM:\n_ TSM looked better against tougher opponents than Fox did.\n_ Fox won't have a carry unless Rush pops off. * Bot lane difference.</li>\n<li>C9 (1-1) v GGS (0-2) -> C9\n_ Golden Guardians were a mess in week 1, too many problems to fix in a week.\n_ Cloud 9 could easily lane kingdom GGS. * Expect Sneaky to pop off.</li>\n<li>100T (0-2) v Liquid (2-0) -> 100T\n_ 100T looked shaky in week 1 but I believe Bang will be the focal point going forward.\n_ Huhi needs to not be useless against Jensen, Ssumday really needs to be the carry</li>\n<li>FlyQuest (2-0) v CLG (0-2) -> FlyQuest\n_ CLG are hot garbage right now.\n_ POE roughly == Pobelter, Wildturtle > Stixxay * Santorin > Wiggly/Moon</li>\n<li>Clutch (2-0) v Optic (1-1) -> Clutch\n_ Clutch basically win all 3 of the 5 positions.\n_ Dardoch and Crown would need to seriously hard carry for Optic to have a chance. * Clutch are a high variance team however so they could under perform.</li>\n</ul>\n<h1><em>Day Two:</em></h1>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>GGS v 100T -> 100T\n_ Both teams under-performed last week, particularly 100T.\n_ Bang and Aphromoo will perform better. * Hauntzer v Ssumday will decide early game. I think Ssumday will win that.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Optic v Echo Fox -> Echo Fox\n_ Echo Fox has a more well rounded bot lane.\n_ Rush > Dardoch or Meteos. * Crown would need to hard carry, not sure if he's going to have to resources.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Liquid v Clutch Gaming -> Liquid\n_ Liquid has much more experience and is a more consistent team.\n_ Argument could be made that all 5 TL players > all 5 Clutch players. The only counterpoint is that Huni > Impact but I don't think that wins Clutch the game.\n_ Clutch would need to win middle and bot lane to have a chance.\n_ Damonte might just hard int against Jensen.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>TSM v FlyQuest -> TSM\n_ Bjergsen should win lane verse Pobelter.\n_ BrokenBlade was beating Ssumday and Huni in lane. Viper is most definitely not the same class of Top Laner.\n_ Zmoothie > WildTurtle and JayJ.\n_ TSM will win as long as they transition to mid-game correctly and are proactive in the early game.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>C9 v CLG -> C9\n_ Licorice is going chomp Darshan or FallenBandit.\n_ Nisqy and the Bot Lane duo should both win or go even at least as long as they turn their monitors on.\n_ Svenskeren / Blabber are simply better junglers than Wiggly or Moon right now.\n_ CLG had way too many problems last week. Weldon could literally be Dumbledore and I doubt he'd know a spell to fix all their problems in a week.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><em>TL;DR:</em></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>100T: 2-0</li>\n<li>Cloud 9: 2-0</li>\n<li>TSM: 2-0</li>\n<li>Clutch: 1-1</li>\n<li>Echo Fox: 1-1</li>\n<li>FlyQuest: 1-1</li>\n<li>Team Liquid: 1-1</li>\n<li>CLG: 0-2</li>\n<li>GGS: 0-2</li>\n<li>Optic: 0-2</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"LCS Week 2 Predictions:","postDate":"Saturday, February 2nd, 2019, 9:18 pm","latestEditDate":"Saturday, February 2nd, 2019, 9:18 pm","datePrefix":"Posted"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Week 2 LCS Predictions/"}}
