{"data":{"markdownRemark":{"html":"<h2>\n    So let me paint the scene for you first:\n</h2>\n<p>   \n    I'm not <i>normally</i> fond of Web development. I'd much prefer write a program in Python or Java or (even C# for that matter) than spend my time mucking around with dozens of different frameworks, convetions, etc.  \n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n     However; I'm not blind, nor am I stupid. I'm very aware that Web development is the way of the future in this industry and I'd like not to be left behind before I've even gotten a job. I've been meaning to buid myself a\n     personal blog / portfolio for a few months now - but I didn't know where to start.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n\tThe most recent web development I'd done was at ThoughtWorks' LevelUp Build program which used a custom built framework using Handlebars, JEST, and NodeJS. I found it really easy to use and was astounded at how simple some\n\tthings are in web development. Unfortunately, the framework wasn't really designed for creating REAL webpages and more so a cute little webtoy that emulated a not-so-smart smartwatch. (I loved LevelUp though and would totally \n\trecommend it to my Developer friends.) Regardless, I felt I was at a loss for where-to-start again. \n</p>\n<br>\n<h2>\n<i>\n    So what is GatsbyJS?\n   </i>\n</h2>\n<br>\n<h2>\n<i>\n    So what is GatsbyJS?\n    </i>\n</h2>","frontmatter":{"title":"GatsbyJS:","date":"01-11-2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/GatsbyJS and Web development/"}}
