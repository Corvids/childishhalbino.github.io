I'd much prefer write a program in Python or Java or (even C# for that matter) than spend my time mucking around with dozens of different frameworks, convetions, etc.  \n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n     However; I'm not blind, nor am I stupid. I'm very aware that Web development is the way of the future in this industry and I'd like not to be left behind before I've even gotten a job. I've been meaning to buid myself a\n     personal blog / portfolio for a few months now - but I didn't know where to start.\n</p>\n<br>\n<p>\n\tThe most recent web development I'd done was at ThoughtWorks' LevelUp Build program which used a custom built framework using Handlebars, JEST, and NodeJS. I found it really easy to use and was astounded at how simple some\n\tthings are in web development. Unfortunately, the framework wasn't really designed for creating REAL webpages and more so a cute little webtoy that emulated a not-so-smart smartwatch. (I loved LevelUp though and would totally\n\trecommend it to my Developer friends.) Regardless, I felt I was at a loss for where-to-start again. I decided to ask the ThoughtWorkers for some advice and they said <i>'Just start from scratch with raw HTML, CSS, and JS'</i>\n</p>\n<br>\n<h2>\n<i>\n    So that's what I did:\n</i>\n</h2>\n<br>\n<p>\n\tI wrote a very crude site with a header and a footer but I soon realised that I was copy-pasting code all of the place and it never <i>quite</i> looked the way I wanted it too. I felt really frustrated that I hadn't\n\treally progressed since Year 10 IST in terms of Web Development. I could visuallise a nice looking website and I could <i>almost</i> get what I wanted but being a perfectionist - I never felt right posting it. If I\n\twas going to make it in the software industry - I was going to have to work this out.\n</p>\n<br>\n<h2>\n<i>\n    'and then the lightbulb went \"dink\"':\n</i>\n</h2>\n<br>\n<p>\n\tI was at work one day; think it was a Friday, and we were\n</p>\n<br>\n<br>\n<h2>\n<i>\n    So what is GatsbyJS?\n</i>\n</h2>\n<br>\n<p>\n</p>\n<br>","frontmatter":{"title":"GatsbyJS:","date":"01-11-2018"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/GatsbyJS and Web development/"}}
