I think Ssumday will win that.</li>\n<li>Optic v Echo Fox -> Echo Fox\n_ Echo Fox has a more well rounded bot lane.\n_ Rush > Dardoch or Meteos. * Crown would need to hard carry, not sure if he's going to have to resources.</li>\n<li>Liquid v Clutch Gaming -> Liquid\n_ Liquid has much more experience and is a more consistent team.\n_ Argument could be made that all 5 TL players > all 5 Clutch players. The only counterpoint is that Huni > Impact but I don't think that wins Clutch the game.\n_ Clutch would need to win middle and bot lane to have a chance.\n_ Damonte might just hard int against Jensen.</li>\n<li>TSM v FlyQuest -> TSM\n_ Bjergsen should win lane verse Pobelter.\n_ BrokenBlade was beating Ssumday and Huni in lane. Viper is most definitely not the same class of Top Laner.\n_ Zmoothie > WildTurtle and JayJ.\n_ TSM will win as long as they transition to mid-game correctly and are proactive in the early game.</li>\n<li>C9 v CLG -> C9\n_ Licorice is going chomp Darshan or FallenBandit.\n_ Nisqy and the Bot Lane duo should both win or go even at least as long as they turn their monitors on.\n_ Svenskeren / Blabber are simply better junglers than Wiggly or Moon right now.\n_ CLG had way too many problems last week. Weldon could literally be Dumbledore and I doubt he'd know a spell to fix all their problems in a week.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2><em>TL;DR:</em></h2>\n<ul>\n<li>100T: 2-0</li>\n<li>Cloud 9: 2-0</li>\n<li>TSM: 2-0</li>\n<li>Clutch: 1-1</li>\n<li>Echo Fox: 1-1</li>\n<li>FlyQuest: 1-1</li>\n<li>Team Liquid: 1-1</li>\n<li>CLG: 0-2</li>\n<li>GGS: 0-2</li>\n<li>Optic: 0-2</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"LCS Week 2 Predictions:","postDate":"Saturday, February 2nd, 2019, 9:18 pm","latestEditDate":"Saturday, February 2nd, 2019, 9:18 pm","datePrefix":"Posted"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/Week 2 LCS Predictions/"}}
